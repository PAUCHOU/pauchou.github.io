		<div class="about content">
			<p>I moved to the Bay Area from New York only about 8 months ago.  I moved here to get started on my job as an inside sales at a small company that supplys metal parts to different companies.  I'm a pretty friendly guy, I love to make new friends and people find me easy to be around with. I value my friends and family a lot because I know they will always be there for me. During my free time, I like to go out and explore the bay, from Napa to Santa Cruz, I enjoy every bit of it.  Occasionally, I like to stay in and enjoy the time with myself, surf the web and play some video games with my friends back home.</p>

		<div class="experience content">
			<p>Currently, I am an inside sales at Advanced Metal Solutions which supplys cutomized metal parts.  My job there is to provide excellent customer service and follow up with factories to make sure everything goes as accordingly.  I also have to communicate with customer to help them find what they are looking for, including the design of the part and suggest best process to manufacture the product.  At last, once everything is settled down, I have to ensure the quality of the part remain consistant once we go on mass production.  I've also interned as an industrial engineer at two different companies that manufactures very different products. One of the company, Bo-An Inc, is a company that assembles bicycles and scooters in China.  I was responsible in making sure that the assembly line was functioning smoothely and efficiently as well as communicating between the factory and client. Another company I've interned at was Chimei-Innolux, a company that manufactures flat-panels that goes on television and smartphones.  My job there was to create a equipment list to keep track of all the machines the company currently possess in the entire factory.
